# Project Overview

**Project Overview and Legal Compliance**

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**Introduction**</mark>

This project is a significant rework of the QBCore framework for FiveM, focused on delivering a highly realistic and immersive server experience. It includes:

* **Custom UI design**
* **Advanced system improvements**
* **Original scripts**, alongside free and open-source community resources.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**Licensing and Use of Open-Source Content**</mark>

This server setup uses a combination of original scripts and freely available open-source scripts from the FiveM community. In compliance with open-source licenses, we ensure:

* **Attribution**: Every script, map, or asset created by others is properly credited.
* **Open-Source Distribution**: All scripts that come under open-source licenses remain accessible and modifiable by anyone who uses them.

All third-party resources used in the project can be found in this category: **Download Free Scripts Here**. These scripts are free for anyone to download, modify, and use.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**What You Are Buying**</mark>

When you purchase this server setup via Tebex, you're not paying for the scripts themselves, as many are available for free. Instead, you're purchasing:

* **My time and expertise**: The effort it takes to configure, organize, and optimize the server for a seamless experience.
* **Custom features**: New scripts, system modifications, and UI enhancements that are unique to this project.
* **Pre-configured setup**: A complete, ready-to-use server, which saves buyers the time and technical know-how required to build and customize from scratch.
* **Support**: Assistance to ensure the server works as intended.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**Open-Source Commitment**</mark>

We respect the principles of open-source software, ensuring that all third-party scripts remain open-source. Any modifications or enhancements made to these scripts will also be available publicly, allowing anyone to:

* Access and modify the source code.
* Redistribute it in line with the original license terms.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**Respect for Original Creators**</mark>

If any creator whose scripts or assets are included in this project wishes to **revoke permission** for their work to be used, or if they **change the licensing** terms, they are encouraged to contact me directly. I will promptly address any concerns, either by removing the asset or updating the license terms in the project.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**Transparency Against Leaks and Scammers**</mark>

This project is built on a foundation of respect for creators and their contributions. Unlike many pre-made server setups that are sold by leakers or scammers, I am committed to maintaining full transparency and compliance with all licensing agreements. No part of this project contains leaked or stolen content.

Every resource has been sourced from legitimate creators, and I will continue to uphold the integrity of the open-source community. This is not just a server for saleâ€”it's a project built with care, collaboration, and respect for the FiveM community.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">**Conclusion**</mark>

By purchasing this server, you are gaining access to a high-quality, pre-configured FiveM setup, built on open-source principles, and enhanced by custom scripts and features. We welcome collaboration, transparency, and open communication with creators to ensure that the project remains compliant, ethical, and respectful of the hard work that goes into creating these resources.
