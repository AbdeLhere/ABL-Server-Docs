# Byte Labs

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction</mark>

Welcome to Byte Labs, your ultimate destination for cutting-edge FiveM scripts that redefine the boundaries of virtual experiences. Your adventure begins with us â€“ welcome to Byte Labs, where innovation knows no bounds.

### <mark style="color:purple;">What is Byte Labs?</mark>

Byte Labs is both an [Open Source Organisation(opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/Byte-Labs-Studio) and a [Fivem Store(opens in a new tab)](https://store.byte-labs.net/). Which both provides high quality resources for both server owners and developers.

Byte Labs consist of a Core Team and a Community Team. The Core Team is responsible for the development of Byte Labs Flagship releases, while the Community Team consist of developers who are willing to contribute to the organisation both through releasing or heavily contributing to Open Source and/or releasing their own paid resources through the organisation.

Either way, there is a level of standard that is met before anything is released under Byte Labs whether it is Open Source or Paid.
